        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
        <p>Analyse the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        We'll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we 
        won't have both homework problems, but we won't have both homework 
        problems and a test.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(R\) stand for the statement "we'll have a reading 
            assignment" as and let \(H\) stand for the statement "we'll have 
            homework problems" then we can write the statement as
            \[(R \lor H) \land \neg (R \land H)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        You won't go skiing, or you will and there won't be any snow.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(K\) stand for the statement "you will go skiing" and 
            let \(S\) stand for the statement "there will be snow" then we can 
            write the statement as
            \[\neg K \lor (K \land \neg S)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>c</h3>
        <p>
        \[\sqrt{7} \nleq 2\]
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(A\) be \(\sqrt{7} \lt 2\) and let B be \(\sqrt{7} = 2\)
            then we can write the statement as
            \[\neg(A \land B)\]
            </p>
        </a>

        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
        <p>Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        Either John and Bill are both telling the truth, or neither of them is.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(J\) stand for the statement "John tells the truth" and
            let \(B\) stand for the statement "Bill tells the truth" then we
            can write the statement as
            \[(J \land B) \lor (\neg J \land \neg B)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        I'll have either fish or chicken, but I won't have both fish and mashed
        potatoes.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(F\) stand for the statement "I'll have fish" and let
            \(C\) stand for the statement "I'll have chicken" and let \(M\)
            stand for the statement "I'll have mashed potatoes" then we can
            write the statement as
            \[(F \lor C) \land \neg (F \land M)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>c</h3>
        <p>3 is a common divisor of 6, 9 and 15</p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(A\) be "\(3\) divides \(6\)" and let \(B\) be "\(3\)
            divides \(9\) and let \(C\) be "\(3\) divides \(15\)" then we can
            write the statement as
            \[A \land B \land C\]
            </p>
