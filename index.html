        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
        <p>Analyse the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        We'll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we 
        won't have both homework problems, but we won't have both homework 
        problems and a test.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define the statement "we'll have a reading assignment" as 
            \(R\) and "we'll have homework problems" as \(H\) then we can write
            the statement as
            \[(R \lor H) \land \neg (R \land H)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        You won't go skiing, or you will and there won't be any snow.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define "you will go skiing" as \(K\) and "there will be snow"
            as \(S\) then we can write the statement as
            \[\neg K \lor (K \land \neg S)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>c</h3>
        <p>
        \[\sqrt{7} \nleq 2\]
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define \(\sqrt{7} \lt 2\) as \(A\) and \(\sqrt{7} = 2\) as B 
            then we can write the statement as
            \[\neg(A \land B)\]
            </p>
        </a>

        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
        <p>Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        Either John and Bill are both telling the truth, or neither of them is.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define "John tells the truth" as \(J\) and "Bill tells the 
            truth" as \(B\) then we can write the statement as
            \[(J \land B) \lor (\neg J \land \neg B)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        I'll have either fish or chicken, but I won't have both fish and mashed
        potatoes.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define "I'll have fish" as \(F\) and "I'll have chicken" as 
            \(C\) and "I'll have mashed potatoes" as \(M\) then we can write the
            statemement as
            \[(F \lor C) \land \neg (F \land M)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>c</h3>
        <p>3 is a common divisor of 6, 9 and 15</p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we define "\(3\) divides \(6\)" as \(A\) and "\(3\) divides 
            \(9\)" as \(B\) and "\(3\) divides \(15\)" as \(C\) then we can 
            write the statement as
            \[A \land B \land C\]
            </p>
