        <h1>Exercises page 13</h1>

        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
        <p>Analyse the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        We'll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we won't have
        both homework problems, but we won't have both homework problems and a test.
        </p>
        <solution>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
        If we define the statement "we'll have a reading assignment" as \(R\) and "we'll
        have homework problems" as \(H\) then we can write the statement as
        \[(R \lor H) \land \neg (R \land H)\]
        </p>
        </solution>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        You won't go skiing, or you will and there won't be any snow.
        </p>
        <solution>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
        If we define "you will go skiing" as \(K\) and "there will be snow" as \(S\) 
        then we can write the statement as
        \[\neg K \lor (K \land \neg S)\]
        </p>
        </solution>
        <h3>c</h3>
        <p>
        \[\sqrt{7} \nleq 2\]
        </p>
        <solution>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
        If we define \(\sqrt{7} \lt 2\) as \(A\) and \(\sqrt{7} = 2\) as B then we
        can write the statement as
        \[\neg(A \land B)\]
        </p>
        </solution>

        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
        <p>Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>Either John and Bill are both telling the truth, or neither of them is.</p>
        <solution>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
        If we define "John tells the truth" as \(J\) and "Bill tells the truth" as 
        \(B\) then we can write the statement as
        \[(J \land B) \lor (\neg J \land \neg B)\]
        </p>
        </solution>
