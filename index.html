        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
        <p>Analyse the logical forms of the following statements:</p>
        <h3>a</h3>
        <p>
        We'll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we 
		won't have both homework  problems and a test.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(R\) stand for the statement "we'll have a reading 
            assignment" as and let \(H\) stand for the statement "we'll have 
            homework problems" then we can write the statement as
            \[(R \lor H) \land \neg (R \land H)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        You won't go skiing, or you will and there won't be any snow.
        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
            If we let \(K\) stand for the statement "you will go skiing" and 
            let \(S\) stand for the statement "there will be snow" then we can 
            write the statement as
            \[\neg K \lor (K \land \neg S)\]
            </p>

            If we let \(A\) be \(\sqrt{7} \lt 2\) and let B be \(\sqrt{7} = 2\)
            then we can write the statement as

        </p>
        <a class=solution>
            <h4>Solution</h4>

            If we let \(J\) stand for the statement "John tells the truth" and
            let \(B\) stand for the statement "Bill tells the truth" then we
            can write the statement as
            \[(J \land B) \lor (\neg J \land \neg B)\]
            </p>
        </a>
        <h3>b</h3>
        <p>
        I'll have either fish or chicken, but I won't have both fish and mashed
        potatoes.

            \(C\) stand for the statement "I'll have chicken" and let \(M\)
            stand for the statement "I'll have mashed potatoes" then we can

            \[(F \lor C) \land \neg (F \land M)\]
            </p>

            divides \(9\) and let \(C\) be "\(3\) divides \(15\)" then we can
            write the statement as

            </p>
        </a>
