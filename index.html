            assignment" as and let \(H\) stand for the statement "we'll have 
            homework problems" then we can write the statement as

		<h2>Exercise 9</h2>
		<p>
		Identify the premises and conclusions of the following deductive 
		arguments and analyze their logical forms. Do you think the reasoning
		is valid? (Although you will have only your intuition to guide you in
		answering this last question, in the next section we will develop some
		techniques for determining the validity of arguments.)
		</p>
		<h3>a</h3>
		<p>
		Jane and Pete won't both win the same math prize. Pete will win either
		the math prize or the chemistry prize. Jane will win the math prize.
		Therefore, Pete will win the chemistry prize.
		</p>
		<a class=solution>
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			If we let \(M(J)\) stand for the statement "Jane will win the math
			prize", \(C(J)\) stand for the statement "Jane will win the 
			chemistry prize", \(M(P)\) stand for the statement "Pete will win 
			the math prize" and \(C(P)\) stand for the statement "Pete will win 
			the chemistry prize".
			Then we can write the problem statement as
			\[\neg(M(J) \land M(P)) \land (M(P) \lor C(P)) \land M(J) \implies
			C(P)\]
			The reasoning is valid.
			</p>
		</a>
		<h3>b</h3>
		<p>
		The main course will be either beef or fish. The vegetable will be 
		either peas or corn. We will not have both fish as a main course and  
		corn as a vegetable. Therefore, we will not have both beef as a main 
		course and peas as a vegetable.
		</p>
		<a class=solution>
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			If we let \(B\) stand for the statement "the main course will be
			beef", \(F\) for the satement "the main course will be fish", \(P\) 
			for the statement "the vegetable will be peas" and \(C\) for the 
			statement "the vegetable will be corn". Then we can write the 
			problem statement as 
			\[(B \oplus F) \land (P \oplus C) \land \neg (F \land C) \implies 
			\neg (B \land P)\] 
			We can still have fish and peas, beef and peas and beef and corn.
			The reasoning is wrong.
			</p>
		</a>
		<h3>c</h3>
		<p>
		Either John or Bill is telling the truth. Either Sam or Bill is lying.
		Therefore, either John is telling the truth or Sam is lying.
		</p>
		<a class=solution>
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			If we let \(J\) stand for the statement "John is telling the truth"
			, \(B\) stand for the statement "Bill is telling the truth" and 
			\(S\) stand for the statement "Sam is telling the truth". Then we 
			can rewrite the problem statement as
			\[(J \oplus B) \land (\neg S \oplus \neg B) \implies (J \oplus \neg 
			S)\].
			We can rewrite the premise as
			\[(J \land \neg S) \oplus (J \land \neg B) \oplus (B \land \neg S)
			\]
			It is possible that \(J \land \neg S\) therefore the conclusion is
			wrong.
			</p>
		</a>
		<h4>d</h4>
		<p>
		Either sales will go up and the boss will be happy, or expenses will go
		up and the boss won't be happy. Therefore, sales and expenses will not
		both go up.
		</p>
		<a class=solution>
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			If we let \(S\) stand for the statement "sales will go up", \(E\)
			for the statement "expenses will go up" and \(B\) for the statement
			"the boss is happy" then we can rewrite the problem statement as
			\[(S \land B) \oplus (E \land \neg B) \implies \neg (S \land E)\]
			This reasoning is correct.
